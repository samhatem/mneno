create a table with articles and whose paid for them

backend only sends request to the smart contract for if that person has paid
    more sc calls than creating a proof of payment and validating it but also easier


calls to backend need a signature along with the public key to verify that the call is
coming from the person who paid
    verify the signature matches the public key
    check that the public key is listed in the sc as having paid



Content in the database should be indexable by their postid

// create fork of orbit db doc store that authenticates requests for files
